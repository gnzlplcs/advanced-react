## sources

+ [React Prop Types](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html#proptypes)
+ [composition > inheritance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMtDGfHWpA)

## reusability

+ DRY: don't repeat yourself
+ inheritance: classes and subclasses / and composition: small chunks of code
+ it's preferable composition over inheritance
+ components w/props
+ children
+ high-order components
+ render props
