        Part 2: Call the function the DataFetcher is expecting. If should receive the data and the loading state, and return the JSX that makes use of that info. If the data is still loading, display "Loading..." in an h1 element, and once the data has loaded, just display the data with `<p>{JSON.stringify(data)}</p>`

        Remember: With the render props pattern, you can use a custom prop (typically called `render`), OR you can use `props.children`. Based on what's already written here for you, you should be able to figure out which of these we're using. (You may have to make changes to the DataFetcher component based on what you see here.)
