 * Challenge: Fill in the blanks in the code here (part 1) and in the App.js

 *
 * Render props are meant to allow us to re-use functionalty in multiple places.
 * If your app were never to become more complicated than what we have here, it's
 * probably not worth the effort to create a separate data fetching component.
 *
 * HOWEVER, if you did find yourself repeating these things (setting a loading state,
 * returning data, etc.) over and over in your app, a component like this might
 * make sense to build.
 *
 * Tip: you can use your browser's dev tools to inspect the full React errors
 * in the console. Click in the menu bar above the editor to access the real
 * right-click menu, or use your browser's shortcut code to get to the dev tools.

       * Also, there's more than one "correct" way to make use of the render
       * props pattern. Check App.js to determine which way it's being implemented
